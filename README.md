# The Verge: "AI Issue"

A few years ago The Verge released a [digital collection of AI-focused articles](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18194816/ai-artificial-intelligence-issue) from their platform. I'm a fan of digital magazines, they make use of a content structure that people are familiar with, and use technology to improve user experience. Anytime a new AI article gets published on the site, The Verge can review and classify it under its existing collection--letting users access similar content easily.
